# Callify

Callify is a real-time **1:1 video calling platform** built using **WebRTC**. This project focuses on implementing the core concepts of peer-to-peer communication, signaling, and live audio/video streaming on the web.

This is **Version 1 (v1)** of the project and is mainly intended for learning, experimentation, and validating the real-time communication flow.

## 🚀 Features

* One-to-one (1:1) video calling
* Real-time audio & video streaming
* WebRTC-based peer-to-peer connection
* WebSocket-based signaling
* Simple and clean user flow

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Frontend**

* Next.js
* WebRTC APIs

**Backend**

* Node.js
* WebSocket

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Users join a room
2. WebSocket is used for signaling (offer, answer, ICE candidates)
3. WebRTC establishes a peer-to-peer connection
4. Live audio and video streams are exchanged directly between users
